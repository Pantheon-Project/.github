# Pantheon Project

This project is a place where I occasionally spend a few spare minutes developing on some ideas I have for different apps and such.
There's plenty of ideas I have that I'll never actually, practically do in my lifetime, but I try to record all the ideas here as if I were going to have the time and resources to do every project I ever imagined.

General convention is to theme names around ancient Greek gods.
Just seemed fun.
I occasionally use Greek letters or philosophers in the naming, but don't have a hard-and-fast convention of when to use them, other than the letters are generally for use with programming languages, following the convention of naming languages after latin letters.

Big table of ideas:
